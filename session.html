        <h3 id="patching" style="color:#c81f23;">Patching a Diverse Set of Campus Computer Labs Using LANDesk (Session 201)</h3>
        <h4>Matt Brooks - Technology Support Professional</h4>
        <h5>SUNY Oswego</h5>
        <p>Until 2017, SUNY Oswego never had a true method for patching computer labs around our campus. With our LANDesk Management Suite overhaul, and our deployment of Windows 10, we've now adopted an ITSM model for patching our labs over the course of a scaled deployment once a month. Our patch process includes the OS, Office, and third-party application patches. This presentation will review our challenges, the evolving process, the human element, and our successes along the way.</p>

        <h3 id="windowsSoftware" style="color:#c81f23;">Windows Software Packaging With Chocolatey! (Session 301)</h3>
        <h4>Houston Griffith - Manager, Labs and Classrooms Computing</h4>
        <h5>Virginia Commonwealth University</h5>
        <p>Do you hate using outdated software deployment tools that rely on internal SMB/CIFS shares to deploy software to client end-points? Fed up with group policy software deployment never happening when you want it to? Does writing Puppet manifests to deploy a simple software package make you want to pull your hair out? Well now you don't have to! Come see how a little tool called Chocolatey that uses the industry-standard NuGet (originally a software sharing mechanism) can turn your life around and save you a TON of time. In this session, I will take participants on a journey through a basic introduction to software package management on Windows (client and server operating systems) and an in-depth look at how Chocolatey works and can save time, effort, and help get to that single Windows operating system image we've all been dreaming of (10 minutes). With demonstrations throughout the presentation (10 minutes), I will attempt to teach even the saltiest of system stewards how to effectively create Chocolatey packages, set up an internal web server for distribution, and leverage existing behind-the-firewall infrastructure such as SMB/CIFS fileshares, end-point management solutions (SCCM, LANDesk, KACE, etc.), and even group policy. Finally, after a short Q&A I will offer a workshop format during the remaining session time and provide hands-on assistance to participants who wish to try building a Chocolatey package for themselves. Participants do not need to know PowerShell to take part in the course, but a basic understanding will help.</p>

        <h3 id="leveraging" style="color:#c81f23;">Leveraging Open Source Solutions for Lab Management (FOG, Puppet, Chocolatey) (Session 401)</h3>
        <h4>Imraan Khan - Help Desk Support Specialst II</h4>
        <h5>Sarah Lawrence College</h5>
        <p>In an effort to save on costs, institutions worldwide are increasingly turning to open source software for their technology needs. FOG (Free Open Ghost) is a powerful and versatile software that presents a comprehensive open source solution for lab administrators looking to automate workstation imaging. Used in conjunction with Puppet and Chocolatey, administrators can leverage absolute control over workstation installations, updates, and imaging. This presentation especially focuses on leveraging FOG to image PCs and using Puppet to achieve a defined state of software installation and configuration. After an introduction to each software, attendees will be taken through the use of each and how they work together, followed by (hopefully) live demonstrations.</p>

        <h3 id="automatedWindows" style="color:#c81f23;">Automated Windows Image Generation With Open Source Tools (Session 501)</h3>
        <h4>Houston Griffith - Manager, Labs and Classrooms Computing</h4>
        <h5>Virginia Commonwealth University</h5>
        <p>If you loathe the long, laborious, and lamentable task of creating a new Windows operating system image, then fear not -- this session is for you! Participants will learn how to start thinking like an automation engineer by doing what those folks do best. I will cover a basic introduction as well as an in-depth look at how to build images using a variety of Microsoft and open source tools including PowerShell, Hyper-V, Packer, Vagrant, Chef, Git, and others. A basic demonstration of the process of automating the generation of a Windows client operating system image (Windows 10) will be kicked off approximately halfway through the presentation, and there will be a short 10-minute Q&A at the end.</p>

        <h3 id="zfs" style="color:#c81f23;">ZFS File System in Desktop Lab Environment (Session 601)</h3>
        <h4>Alexei Kotelnikov - Associate Director of Information Technology</h4>
        <h5>Rutgers School of Engineering, Engineering Computing Services</h5>
        <h5>Co-presenter:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Trent Handlovsky</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When administrating multi-user computer labs, there are many aspects that need to be properly addressed. Some of the main questions are "How will the computers be secured so that as the next user logs in, minimal to no personal data is left behind?" and "How will the machines receive updates or changes?". The answers our group has devised to these questions utilize a ZFS-based filing system for maintaining the required Linux/Windows computing environment. This file system allows for snapshots of the filesystem dataset to be taken as checkpoints. Using the filesystem for directories where users store data as well as a virtual machine disk for Windows and reverting these directories and files back to a snapshot of the file system before the next user logs in assures for a clean and secure environment. Thanks to this checkpoint nature of the filesystem, sending and receiving filesystem updates, as well as the whole file system, is a very simple and easily scalable process.</p>

        <h4>Fuller Ming - Assistant Director for IT, Dining Services</h4>
        <h5>University of Maryland, College Park</h5>
        <p>There are many vendors that provide pay-for-print solutions to help cover the cost of printing in labs. Here at the University of Maryland, we actually have three solutions in place! Come learn the good, bad, and ugly about pay-for-print in a lab or across campus. Learn about Pharos, PaperCut, and Wepa and how they all integrate with the student ID card for payment. Learn about management and support issues for each system and things your campus should consider if you implement such systems, or how you can improve what you already do. You can also meet Wepa reps and ask questions.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>The nature and use of technology is constantly evolving in higher education. The emergence and the importance of esports has increased significantly in the last few years. In addition, there are also increasing constraints on physical and financial resources. At Weber State University, we collaborated to leverage resources from Housing and Residence Life, Student Clubs and Organizations, Bookstore, and faculty to innovatively convert a traditional open lab, into an esports lab, while still providing traditional academic services. Our presentation will discuss our experience collaborating with these various groups including challenges we faced and the things we learned along the way. The presentation will entail an interactive game, visual presentation, group discussion, and a video. Following are the presentation learning outcomes: understanding the importance of collaboration and innovation to meet the evolving needs of students, overcoming the stigma attached to esports in higher ed, conveying the benefits of embracing esports on campus.</p>

        <h3 id="devanddep" style="color:#c81f23;">Development and Deployment of the University of Nebraska's Lightboard Design (Session 302)</h3>
        <h4>Greg Carstens - Audio Visual Design Engineer</h4>
        <h5>University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Information Technology Services, Learning and Emerging Technologies</h5>
        <h5>Co-presenter:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Brad Severa</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The University of Nebraska Learning and Emerging Technology team liked the idea of the Lightboard but saw several design aspects to improve upon. We designed and built our version in house and then tested our beta version with several key faculty members. The University of Nebraska model added several key improvements, including portability and height adjustability to suit faculty who are seated as well as individuals who are well over six feet tall. Lightboard allows faculty to engage with students face-to-face at the board. The Lightboard allows an instructor to face the students - this maintains better eye contact and creates a more deliberate presentation. It also replaces the traditional teaching method of looking over one's shoulder to teach while at the white board. The clear board and use of neon markers on a glass surface creates vivid and engaging content.</p>

        <h4>Lars Sorensen - Sr. Instructional Technologist</h4>
        <h5>Computer Science, Rutgers University</h5>
        <p>Wanting to reinvigorate interest in their computing labs, Rutgers University embarked on a new path for their instructional labs in the fall of 2010. Considering a mixture of best practices for collaborative spaces and the insights of “Third Spaces,” the CAVE, a domain specific collaborative computer lab was created. In past LabMan presentations, we told the story of how the CAVE was developed and built; now we turn our attention to tweaks, tricks, and techniques for acting as an informational hub for your program, supporting and creating new university clubs, running tutoring programs, and benefiting from curating the setting of a community of practice. This year’s theme, technology driven collaborative learning, is a perfect fit for the CAVE, a domain specific collaborative computing lab.</p>

        <h4>Megan Deaton - IT Coordinator</h4>
        <h5>University of Maryland, College Park</h5>
        <p>It is often said the most consistent aspect of working with technology in higher education is that it is ever changing. The University of Maryland, College Park recently underwent some pretty big advancements with the technology provided inside the classroom and how we support our campus community. There were a lot of moving pieces happening at one time, and the student employees truly were the unsung heroes for being able to adapt day to day as we navigated a sticky web of unknowns at the beginning of the academic year. In this session, I will discuss the challenges we faced and how we as a team overcame them. I will discuss the importance of trust, good hands-on training, and performance assessment, as well as experiences scheduling 50+ students while trying to remain adaptable.</p>

        <p>Are you tired of allocating up to 80% of your IT budget on infrastructure and only 20% to services delivery? Learn how today’s cloud can invert that paradigm while improving user services and overall student experience. Embracing the cloud to support student technology services is not about asking if but when and how IT can begin the transition. Students, faculty, and staff are already relying on cloud services every day. Transitioning your student technology services to the cloud offers IT departments real solutions, particularly when delivered by a vendor that understands higher education. Key areas of impact are: user experience, capability, scalability, cost, and control. The presentation will describe how Wepa impacted these five areas at UMD. Wepa will showcase a live cloud-based application where the audience will have the opportunity in real-time to physically participate in both the user experience and IT onboarding of a student technology service to the cloud.</p>

        <h3 id="labmaster" style="color:#c81f23;">Lab Master: Computer and Software Availability Maps in K2 KeyServer (Session 204)</h3>
        <h4>Jason Schackai - Training and Implementation Specialist</h4>

          <li>Gene Mayro, Temple University</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As our phones get smarter, and more of our communication happens digitally, we have come to expect that we can access any and all data directly from our phones. Collaborative learning spaces are terrific, but only if we can immediately access the productivity tools required to get the job done. So, what happens when a group of students arrives at a computer lab only to discover that all the computers are occupied?</p>

        <p>The expensive "solution" to this problem is to buy enough software to install everywhere and buy enough computers to make labs larger than they need to be, guaranteeing constant availability. But imagine if students could easily track down open computers and see software availability anywhere on campus right from their phones? What if they could check operating hours and see a demand forecast for each lab, allowing them to avoid the availability problem altogether?</p>

        <p>KeyServer's mobile-friendly computer lab availability maps, which can be embedded on any university webpage, are designed to provide all of this functionality and more. Join co-presenters Jason Schackai from Sassafras Software and Gene Mayro from Temple University for a demonstration of the product, including a peek at Temple‚ a real-world implementation, and learn how you can provide students, faculty, and staff with easy, intuitive access lab availability information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hours of operation</li>
          <li>Daily and weekly demand forecast</li>
          <li>Real-time computer log-in status, including operating system and installed software</li>
          <li>Lab software availability list, installation count, and software locator</li>
          <li>Campus-wide software search for tracking down alternate locations for critical applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lab administrators can even use KeyServer's Lab Maps to monitor system health across campus, direct security, and review a heat map of the most used computers. At the end of the session, attendees will be provided a "sneak preview" of powerful new drawing tools for managing graphics, designing lab floor pans, and quickly laying out computer icons, all in the same place.</p>

        <h3 class="mfdbyod" style="color:#c81f23;">From MFDs to BYOD, CRDs to 3D - Extending the Power of Print Management Beyond Just Print (Session 304)</h3>
        <h4>Dale Micallef - Senior Product Marketer</h4>
        <h5>PaperCut Software International</h5>
        <p>Print management -- the term conjures evocative images of systems administrators tracking and controlling who printed what, where, and when; IT managers securing sensitive information to stop it getting into the hands of students; and faculties cutting the amount of wasted paper and stopping students (and teachers) from overwhelming the recycling bin. From humble beginnings, print management has expanded to include copying and scanning functionality. More recently it has included things like BYOD and mobile printing support. So, where is print management going next? In this session we’ll show how we’re taking print management to new parts of the campus (Print Rooms and FabLabs) and solving new challenges using familiar features. We’ll also look at how we’re connecting cloud solutions from Google, Microsoft, Dropbox and others, giving more choice for deployment and scanning. Print management is WAY more exciting than you’d think.</p>

        <h4>Phil Spitze - Director of Business Development</h4>
        <h5>Software2</h5>
        <p>Creating an awesome student experience is a constant moving target for the IT departments in colleges and universities around the world. Recent steps toward this goal have included unrestricted Wi-Fi, student ID payment systems, and online collaborative and storage tools such as Google Docs and Drive and Office 365 and OneDrive. One area that continues to lack a “silver bullet” solution is the delivery of applications needed by students to complete coursework. Tied to computer labs or delivered via a backend-laden pixel streaming solutions, academic software often presents IT departments with numerous challenges related to drivers, dependencies, and licensing. It should be clear that the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) trend is not going away and to satisfy students’ expectations, IT departments should have a platform in place to support and deliver applications to any device, anytime, anywhere. During this presentation, attendees will hear how AppsAnywhere by Software2 can help create a awesome student experience by delivering any app to any device, anywhere, anytime.</p>
