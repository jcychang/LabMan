        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Collaboration in the BYOD Classroom</h3>
        <h4>Gaurav Malik - Co-Founder</h4>
        <h5>nClass</h5>
        <p>For the ideal classroom to exist, it is important that students mingle among themselves and help each other out, to keep the flow of knowledge open and transparent. Collaboration will engage students better and the discussions will help them see a particular topic from different perspectives as well. Communication and Collaboration is an integral part of the college experience and prepares them for the real world. It is important that students interact among themselves, sharing knowledge and hearing diverse opinions. Will demonstrate techniques using tool nClass, Session would involve audience participation more than a presentation / lecture style.</p>

        <h5>Information Technology Services, University of Southern California</h5>
        <p>Pros and Cons of using facetime, or other video platforms, to provide virtual classroom support to customers in our learning spaces. When a customer is in one of our learning spaces and needs support they currently have help phone they can call. At USC we are currently experimenting with using facetime to allow customers to contact our office for support. We are also using facetime to provide virtual training to our student technical assistants when they get stuck on a problem and need additional assistance from a full time staff.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Automated Windows Image Generation with Open-Source tools</h3>
        <h4>Houston Griffith - Manager, Labs and Classrooms Computing</h4>
        <h5>Virginia Commonwealth University</h5>
        <p>If you loathe the long, laborious, and lamentable task of creating a new Windows operating system image, then fear not, this session is for you! In this session, participants will learn how to start thinking like an automation engineer by doing what those folks do best. I will cover a basic introduction as well as an in-depth look at how to build images using a variety of Microsoft and open-source tools including PowerShell, Hyper-V, Packer, Vagrant, Chef, Git, and others. A basic demonstration of the process of automating the generation of a Windows client operating system image (Windows 10) will be kicked off approximately half-way through the presentation with a short 10 minutes Q&A at the end.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Windows Software Packaging with Chocolatey!</h3>
        <h4>Houston Griffith - Manager, Labs and Classrooms Computing</h4>
        <h5>Virginia Commonwealth University</h5>
        <p>Do you hate using outdated software deployment tools that rely on internal SMB/CIFS shares to deploy software to client end-points? Fed up with group policy software deployment never happening when you want it to? Does writing Puppet manifests to deploy a simple software package make you want to pull your hair out? Well now you don't have to! Come see how a little tool called Chocolatey that uses the industry-standard NuGet (originally a software sharing mechanism) can turn your life around and save you a TON of time. In this session, I will take participants on a journey through a basic introduction to software package management on Windows (client and server operating systems) and an in-depth look at how Chocolatey works and can save time, effort, and help get to that single Windows operating system image we've all been dreaming of (10 minutes). With demonstrations throughout the presentation (10 minutes), I will attempt to teach even the saltiest of system stewards how to effectively create Chocolatey packages, setup an internal web-server for distribution, and leverage existing behind-the-firewall infrastructure such as SMB/CIFS fileshares, end-point management solutions (SCCM, LANDesk, KACE, etc), and even group policy. Finally, after a short Q&A I will offer a workshop format for the remaining time of the session and provide hands-on assistance to participants who wish to try building a Chocolatey package for themselves. Participants do not need to know PowerShell to take part in the course but a basic understanding will help.

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Patching a Diverse Set of Campus Computer Labs Using LANDesk</h3>
        <h4>Matt Brooks - Technology Support Professional</h4>
        <h5>SUNY Oswego</h5>
        <p>Until 2017, SUNY Oswego never had a true method for patching computer labs around our campus. With our LANDesk Management Suite overhaul, and our deployment of Windows 10, we've now adopted an ITSM model for patching our labs over the course of a scaled deployment once a month. Our patch process includes the OS, Office, and third-party application patches. This presentation will review our challenges, the evolving process, the human element, and our successes along the way.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Leveraging Open Source Solutions For Lab Management (FOG, Puppet, Chocolatey)</h3>
        <h4>Imraan Khan - Help Desk Support Specialst II</h4>
        <h5>Sarah Lawrence College</h5>
        <p>In an effort to save on costs, institutions worldwide are increasingly turning to open source software for their technology needs. FOG (Free Open Ghost) is a powerful and versatile software that presents a comprehensive open source solution for lab administrators looking to automate workstation imaging. Used in conjunction with Puppet and Chocolatey, administrators can leverage absolute control over workstation installations, updates, and imaging. This presentation especially focuses on leveraging FOG to image PCs, and using Puppet to achieve a defined state of software installation and configuration. After an introduction to each software, attendees will be taken through the use of each and how they work together, followed by (hopefully) live demonstrations.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Powershell - Introduction and Practical Uses</h3>
        <h4>Christopher Wieringa - CS Lab Manager</h4>
        <h5>Calvin College</h5>
        <p>This session will be a technical learning session, introducing Powershell for computer and lab management.  It will cover the basics of how Powershell works, what advantages it has over using batch or VB scripts, and how it can be used remotely to manage labs of computers. We will cover file management, system information and status management, software installs, and Windows update patch management among other things. Attendees will be encouraged to bring their Windows laptop and learn together in their own Powershell session.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Printing Solutions, from Lab to Enterprise</h3>
        <h4>Fuller Ming - Assistant Director for IT</h4>
        <h5>Dining Services, VPSA</h5>
        <p>There are many vendors that provide pay-for-print solutions to help cover the cost of printing in labs.  Here at the University of Maryland, we actually have three solutions in place! Come learn the good, bad, and ugly about Pay-for-Print in a Lab or across campus. Learn about Pharos, PaperCut and WEPA, and how they all integrate with the student ID card for payment. Learn about management and support issues for each system and things your campus should consider if you implement such systems, or how you can improve what you already do.  You can also Meet vendors for WEPA and ask questions</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Managing labs with Citrix Provisioning Server</h3>
        <h4>Jeff McKinney - Director, Engineering IT Operations</h4>
        <h5>University of Maryland, College Park</h5>
        <p>The UMD Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering uses Citrix Provisioning Server (PVS) to manage 150 computers in teaching labs in a very dynamic environment.  Requests for changes are received throughout each semester and require quick response.  This session will describe the environment including the equipment in the teaching labs, software in the teaching labs, the server environment that supports PVS, and the process used to manage the lab computers.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#c81f23;">Lab Master: Computer and Software Availability Maps in K2 KeyServer</h3>
        <h4>Jason Schackai - Training and Implementation Specialist</h4>
        <h5>Sassafras Software</h5>
        <p>As our phones get smarter, and more of our communication happens digitally, we have come to expect that we can access any and all data directly from our phones. Collaborative learning spaces are terrific, but only if we can immediately access the productivity tools required to get the job done. So, what happens when a group of students arrives at a computer lab only to discover that all the computers are occupied?</p>

        <p>The expensive‚ "solution" to this problem is to buy enough software to install everywhere, and buy enough computers to make labs larger than they need to be, guaranteeing constant availability.  But imagine if students could easily track down open computers and software availability‚ "anywhere on campus" right from their phones? What if they could check operating hours and see a demand forecast for each lab, allowing them to avoid the availability problem altogether?</p>

        <p>KeyServer‚ a mobile-friendly Computer Lab Availability Maps, which can be embedded on any university webpage, are designed to provide all of this functionality, and more. Join co-presenters Jason Schackai from Sassafras Software and Gene Mayro from Temple University for this demonstration of the product, including a peek at Temple‚ a real-world implementation, and learn how you can provide students, faculty, and staff with easy, intuitive access lab availability information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hours of operation</li>
          <li>Daily and weekly demand forecast</li>
          <li>Real-time computer log-in status, including operating system and installed software</li>
          <li>Lab software availability list, installation count, and software locator</li>
          <li>Campus-wide software search for tracking down alternate locations for critical applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lab administrators can even use KeyServer's Lab Maps to monitor system health across campus, direct security, and review a heat map of the most used computers. At the end of the session attendees will be provided a "sneak preview" of powerful new drawing tools for managing graphics, designing lab floorpans, and quickly laying out computer icons, all in the same place.</p>
